// The ``Error`` exception describes theproperties common to all standard exceptions. 
//
//  This exception serves two purposes: 
//
// #. It is the exception that clients in many programming languages can catch to handle all standard exceptions. Typically those clients will display one or more of the localizable messages from Error#messages to a human.
// #. It is the exception that methods can report when they need to report some exception, but the exception doesn't fit into any other standard exception, and in fact the only reasonable way for a client to react to the exception is to display the message(s) to a human.
type Error struct {
    // Stack of one or more localizable messages for human exception consumers. 
    //
    //  The message at the top of the stack (first in the list) describes the exception from the perspective of the method the client invoked. Each subsequent message in the stack describes the "cause" of the prior message.
	Messages []std.LocalizableMessage
    // Data to facilitate clients responding to the method reporting a standard exception to indicating that it was unable to complete successfully. 
    //
    //  Methods may provide data that clients can use when responding to exceptions. Since the data that clients need may be specific to the context of the method reporting the exception, different methods that report the same exception may provide different data in the exception. The documentation for each each method will describe what, if any, data it provides for each exception it reports. The null, null, and null classes are intended as possible values for this property. std.DynamicID may also be useful as a value for this property (although that is not its primary purpose). Some interfaces may provide their own specific classes for use as the value of this property when reporting exceptions from their methods.
