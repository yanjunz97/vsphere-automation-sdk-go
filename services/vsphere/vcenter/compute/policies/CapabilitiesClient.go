// The ``Capabilities`` interface provides methods to manage compute policy capabilities in VMware Cloud on AWS. Usage beyond VMware Cloud on AWS is not supported. The description of the capability provides information about the intent of a policy based on this capability. A capability provides a type to create a policy (see Policies#create). A capability also provides a type that describes the information returned when retrieving information about a policy (see Policies#get). **Warning:** This interface is available as Technology Preview. These are early access APIs provided to test, automate and provide feedback on the feature. Since this can change based on feedback, VMware does not guarantee backwards compatibility and recommends against using them in production environments. Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments.
