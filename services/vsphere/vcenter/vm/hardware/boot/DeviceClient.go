// The ``Device`` interface provides methods for configuring the device order used when booting a virtual machine. 
//
//  The boot order may be specified using a mixture of device classes and device instances, chosen from among the following: 
//
// * DeviceType#DeviceType_CDROM: Boot from a virtual CD-ROM drive; the device instance(s) will be chosen by the BIOS subsystem.
// * DeviceType#DeviceType_FLOPPY: Boot from a virtual floppy drive; the device instance(s) will be chosen by the BIOS subsystem.
// * DeviceType#DeviceType_DISK: Boot from a virtual disk device; the device instance is specified explicitly in DeviceEntry#disks list, and multiple instances may be specified in the list.
// * DeviceType#DeviceType_ETHERNET: Boot from a virtual Ethernet adapter; the device instance is specified explicitly as DeviceEntry#nic, and multiple adapters may be specified in the boot order list.
