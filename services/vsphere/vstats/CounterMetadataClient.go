// The ``CounterMetadata`` interface provides access to the different historical editions of counters. As computing platforms evolve over time the measurement units for different characteristics of the systems change. As such changes occur, counters will receive different editions reflected in a new metadata record. For example computer memory had changes from kilobytes through megabytes into gigabytes. **Warning:** This interface is available as Technology Preview. These are early access APIs provided to test, automate and provide feedback on the feature. Since this can change based on feedback, VMware does not guarantee backwards compatibility and recommends against using them in production environments. Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments.

    // This method returns the "default" CounterMetadata. A Counter has at least one related metadata object. Usually, stats providers (for example hosts) are in agreement about the default metadata. In this case the returned list has a single metadata object. 
    //
    //  Sometimes, when providers are in "disagreement" about the default, then the returned list would include all the possible "defaults". This potential ambiguity isn't a real issue because consumers of the vStats API rarely need to specify the "mid" of metadata. Therefore, this API is used primarily for informational purposes.. **Warning:** This method is available as Technology Preview.
