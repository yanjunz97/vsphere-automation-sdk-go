// The ``CounterSets`` interface provides methods for accessing groupings of counters. Counter-sets allow consumers to use groups of counters. The counters may relate to different resource types. When an AcqSpecs record refers to a counter-set, only the relevant counters apply. **Warning:** This interface is available as Technology Preview. These are early access APIs provided to test, automate and provide feedback on the feature. Since this can change based on feedback, VMware does not guarantee backwards compatibility and recommends against using them in production environments. Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments.
