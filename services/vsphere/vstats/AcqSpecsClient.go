// The ``AcqSpecs`` interface provides methods to perform acquisition specification related operations. An acquisition specification defines the statistical data that should be collected at desired sampling rates from the underlying providers. It designates the resources and their counters which should be sampled, and a desired sampling rate. **Warning:** This interface is available as Technology Preview. These are early access APIs provided to test, automate and provide feedback on the feature. Since this can change based on feedback, VMware does not guarantee backwards compatibility and recommends against using them in production environments. Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments.
